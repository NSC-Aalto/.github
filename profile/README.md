# Nonlinear Systems and Control

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the **Nonlinear Systems and Control group** at the **Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Aalto University**.

Our group is led by [Assistant Professor Shankar A. Deka](mailto:shankar.deka@aalto.fi).

## About Us

The research interest of the Nonlinear Systems and Control group lies at the **intersection of Control Theory and Machine Learning**.

We aim to synergistically combine tools from nonlinear systems, stability theory, robust & optimal control along with machine learning and optimization techniques. Our primary goal is to create intelligent systems with **provable guarantees on safety and performance**.

As autonomous systems become ubiquitous—from self-driving cars and medical robots to AI assistants—our work addresses the critical need for safe and intelligent behaviors by carefully analyzing system architecture, feedback, uncertainties, and other problem-specific considerations.

## Research & Impact Areas

Our research focuses on a variety of domains and applications:

*   **Core Methodologies:** Applying principles from dynamical systems to enhance the robustness of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures and training algorithms, with a special focus on Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs).
*   **Application Domains:**
    *   Medical and Rehabilitation Robotics
    *   Precision Agriculture
    *   Multi-agent Systems with Human-in-the-loop
    *   Cyber-physical and Robotic Systems

## Work With Us

We are actively looking for motivated **PhD and Postdoc candidates** with a strong background in **Machine Learning and Mathematical Control Theory**.

Join us and work as a part of the [Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI)](https://fcai.fi/).
